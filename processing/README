This directory wraps some fastjet-contrib files into python
There is  a MakeFile to make the NsubjettinessWrapper python library
So just run 'make' to create everything. 'make clean' also works

Warning : You need to have compiled fastjet-contrib with CXXFLAGS=-fPIC
 eg:  ./configure --fastjet-config=fastjet-config CXXFLAGS=-fPIC
